Information security as such is not a criteria that should be optimized as the three optimization criteria speed, quality and cost. Instead, Finoa must always ensure relevant information security\nrequirements are met when optimizing these criteria. Security is not independent of the three criteria. While higher quality generally has a positive effect on information security, higher speed and lower cost tend to have negative impact.\nWith this in mind, Finoa takes a risk and threat-based approach for its security programme. This is carried out through building a multi- layered defense approach for maximum protection of Finoa\u2019s assets. Currently there are foundational prevention, detection, response and recovery controls in place. Finoa continuously aims to improve the security measures through various means. The company is a member of FS-ISAC to provide access to global financial services threat information sharing as well as topical working groups \u2013 such as decentralized finance and cryptocurrency threats.\nFinoa is in the process of enhancing its security capabilities to augment protection and detection posture while also ensuring to remain agile in order to respond to evolving customer and market needs. Thus, best-practise DDoS, monitoring, and attack prevention capabilities have to be deployed. Due to the fact that most crypto assets rely on asymmetric cryptography, the highest protection is required for customer private keys. Finoa therefore relies on hardware security (HSM) modules and deploys multiple layers of encryption.\nMandatory security training is part of Finoas employee onboarding processes. This is also enhanced with targeted regular and event related training (for example phishing) as Finoa\u2019s threat landscape changes. The End User Computing (EUC) policy is the standard to adhere to for employees when working with IT at Finoa.\n","The management board shall define an IT strategy that is consistent with the business strategy.

Finoa projects a long term horizon for architectural qualities. There are decades of knowledge, experience and literature of the issues ahead as Finoa grows. This insight is captured in a quality roadmap which is internally called Maturity Matrix. It is Finoa\u2019s north-star for quality related concerns that support the three optimization criteria mentioned in the introduction chapter.\nAside from technical concerns that affect scalability, cost structure and footprint, system quality, or speed to deliver, there are also tactical business objectives that must be catered for. These two sets of inputs need to be weighted and prioritized together at each change cycle, so as to make the right trade-offs for the transformation steps in order to support the business as a whole optimally. Below is a high level summary of how the ingredients that go into a transformation step relate, and how they result in an adjustment of the system\u2019s quality and functional state; an architecturally significant system change.","The management board shall define an IT strategy that is consistent with the business strategy.

Typically, an IT Strategy document includes an overview of the application landscape, which would depict the target IT architecture.","Is there a depiction of the target IT architecture in the form of an overview of the application landscape in the IT Strategy?","3 Future Architecture\nIn order to address the inhibitors identified in the previous section, a north star towards which technical initiatives incrementally move the overall system is required. The overall themes for the architecturally significant changes needed to address the identified business inhibitors in the current architecture include:\nAutomation of changes. All changes are declared, revision controlled and subject to 4-eyes review & approval. They are then automatically executed. This increases quality by having changes be consistently applied, certainty that what has been reviewed is also what will change, and a complete record of exactly what was changed as a result. Improves shipping velocity by massively reducing the calendar time and investment that goes into each individual release today.\nOne domain concern, one service. The system is simplified by assigning each given orthogonal concern to a separate component. Simpler things are cheaper to change and maintain, and incur less risk of inadvertent behavioural change when actuated. Reducing both cost of making changes, and time needed to realize a change.\nDecoupling. Of teams, of initiatives, of component dependencies, in time, location and of transitive state. This increases availability and improves resilience.\nThe structural target architecture overview can be contrasted with the current, and looks as follows.\nTarget Architecture Overview Diagram\nThe components and their motivation:\nAdmin panel, unchanged from today in terms of the functional concerns, but slightly improved in terms of centralized security administration through federated users. This increases the quality in terms of timely on\/offboarding and potentially reduces some cost related to administration of back-office users (Finoa employees).\nWeb UI (new), is a modern REST based user interface that separates the user interaction and styling from the domain logic and data persistence. This allows the front-end and back-end services to be developed independently, reduce the scope of testing needed due to smaller changes. Testing of smaller changes translates to saved cost, increased quality due to less risk of inadvertent behavioral changes in areas other than what a change intended, and increases the speed at which functionality and improvements can be made to the user interface.\nOnboarding UI (new), is an improved customer onboarding experience in the form of a web application. It streamlines the entire onboarding process by improving clarity of the process, record keeping of documents \nnarrow scope contributes to mainly increased quality, but potentially also speed depending on the number of future business initiatives that will require a customer approval as part of the process flow, and cost if the company needs to adjust the approval flow in order to capitalize on new opportunities.\nWallet management (new), handles the lifecycling of wallets across the various blockchains that Finoa supports. Centralizing this concern to a distinct service provides the same benefits as for approval management.\nTransaction management (new), orchestrates the end-to-end transfer flow where a customer moves assets between different addresses on chains, and in the future likely cross-chains as well. Contributes to both quality and speed primarily by increasing cohesion, which allows for changes to the flow to not require changes to the entire system, and to allow re-use of transfer functionality which is expected to speed up implementation of new blockchain network supports and new currencies.\nCustomer Data Service (CDS) (new). Centralizes handling of personal information, so that there is a single place in the entire system where customer identity information can be linked to individuals. This significantly simplifies Finoa\u2019s GDPR compliant handling of customers' personal information. The rest of the system relies on pseudo-anonymous identifiers which have no semantic meaning other than to ensure there is referential integrity between different data sets. Without the link that can only be established by CDS, the information spread out through the rest of the system will be guaranteed to not include any personal information. The main value contribution for this service is quality improvement with regard to personal data handling, and to a degree cost & speed, since GDPR concerns need not be re-solved for each new initiative. Instead this standard solution resolves the conflict of Finoa having certain processes that require disclosure of personal information to chosen individuals, who at the same time rely on an IT system that should avoid having it.\nOyster, unchanged compared to the current architecture. Same role and purpose.\nHSM, unchanged compared to the current architecture. Same role and purpose.\nEvent Store (new). An enabler for Finoa transitioning to an Event Sourcing integration style. In such a style services become decoupled in terms of time, identity and location. Services that are asynchronous in nature such as triggering various business events, and the need to respond to such events, have to be integrated asynchronously somehow. That somehow is through event streams (event logs) where potentially relevant business events get published, and to which services can also subscribe in order to be notified when such events happen. Not only does this integration style increase the reliability and availability of the system as a whole, a side-effect is that persistent logs are kept of all business events that cause some data processing to take place. It\u2019s a quality improvement in terms of the granularity of data captured, which makes it possible to use such event logs to drive testing of changes to ensure that those changes cause the intended behavior during the expected business event. For audit logging and security monitoring, the same information can be leveraged to gain a more complete view of what caused the system to change its overall state, and a chronology of those triggering events.\nBlockchain adapters, called Currency services in the current architecture, have been renamed to indicate simplification with fewer responsibilities. These services are tailor made connectors to various blockchain networks tasked with implementing a standard set of Finoa defined financial operations that should be translated to and from the representation a given blockchain requires. These services in contrast to currency services hold no state, and instead rely on derived state through event log reduction. As such there is one single source of truth; the event log, and the adapters contribute to such a log by emitting events of what happens on the respective chains. By integrating the blockchains using an event sourced style will lead to improved speed in terms of implementation and iteration. A side- effect of the change is that integration style using eventing will also improve efficiency that has a concrete line item reduction; reducing the database capacity footprint which translates into reduced cost on our vendor bills.\nBlockchain nodes, unchanged compared to the current architecture. Same role and purpose. We will simply have more of them in the future, since increasing the amount of blockchain networks supported is a key business strategy.\nMFA registration (new), serves to handle the registration flow of multi-factor authentication devices. By separating out this responsibility into a separate service, we minimize scope of change if we need to add additional multi-factor options or adjust the details of how those procedures work. Centralization of the concern leads to both reduced long term cost for multi-factor authentication related changes, and increased quality by having MFA be the concern of one cohesive service that is easier to review and test than having to resort to testing the entire system.\nBilling, unchanged. At present there are known deficiencies in the billing system which makes our billing process expensive to execute. However a business decision has been made that improvements in this area is not a priority. Consequently no specific improvement has been considered as part of the target architecture.\nrequired before a Finoa account can be opened, the process interaction with the AML team, and clarity for both customers and Finoa alike regarding next steps in the process. This all culminates in lower cost of onboarding customers, and increased speed of the overall process. A greater first impression for the customer is a side-effect that is also important from the customer relations and marketing perspectives.\nLogin UI (new, unified) is a centralized authentication user interface which offers Single Sign-on across all Finoa\u2019s planned and future unplanned user interfaces. It is a way for Finoa to centrally manage authentication (login) concerns, in order to surface a unified user experience, regardless of how Finoa internally chooses to structure and partition the individual services that power the user experience. The main priority this component supports is that of Quality, since authentication can be standardized, monitored and handled. This quality then leads to eliminating the additional cost and time required to re-implement the authentication policies and requirements each individual product initiative.\nEmail gateway, largely unchanged from today. Slight improvement by allowing seamless fallback to another mail provider. This would slightly reduce a cost factor Finoa has encountered when there were issues with our primary mail provider.\nMobile gateway, a channel for interacting with the Finoa mobile app, such as for customer transaction approval and future use cases where Finoa want\u2019s to leverage the channel for new opportunities. Makes it faster to leverage and change flows that involve the Finoa mobile application, resulting in lower cost for such initiatives.\nAPI gateway (new), a standardized and hard surface that provides a first line of defence for services. It centralizes coarse grained authorization decisions (policy enforcement) which significantly reduces the attack surface. Within Finoa, by having all services that need to send commands between each other go through a proxy, we decouple the services in terms of identity. This allows different teams to \u201cplugin\u201d to the overall service landscape. The main contribution is on the quality (security) side in terms of Finoa external communication, and shipping speed on the internal.\nAuth service, existing service for all authentication of data access and processing requests in the Finoa developed system. Will be enhanced to support OAuth2, which will then unlock the centralized Login (SSO) experience. By making the service adopt an open standard it will enable Finoa to integrate with more partners, faster and cheaper going forward.\nApproval management (new), serves to orchestrate approval flows (procedures) which other services can leverage for use cases where a customer sign-off is required. With this in place we avoid needing to solve the approval need in each initiative, and it also allows us to scrutinize approval in isolation. Should Finoa need to change the technical implementation of how customer approvals are performed, such a change will be isolated to this single service rather than requiring a system-wide change.

In order to meet the regulatory requirements, Finoa\u2019s IT emergency management is oriented to the ISO Standard 22 301 and focuses on the below described aspects. Its core is formed by the emergency concept, which is written down in the organization\u2019s emergency manual. The aim of the emergency management is to provide a thorough guideline on how to manage an emergency and as a result, reduce the extent of the possible damage. Finoa\u2019s emergency management is based on the \u201cPCDA model\u201d with the phases Planning - Execution - Check - Act. This approach includes procedures for crisis management and also refers to Finoa\u2019s Business Continuity Management (BCM) and Disaster Recovery. Due to the high importance of the organization\u2019s risk management and information security, emergency management is closely interlinked with these areas. For further information on risk management, please refer to Finoa\u2019s risk management policy.\nBy aligning with its BCM, Finoa increases the resilience of its time-critical processes and resources against emergency situations. Additionally, the seamless transition of its time-critical processes from normal to emergency operations is outlined. The primary metric used for these processes is \u201cmaximum time down (MTD)\u201d which is further specified into \"recovery time objective (RTO)\" and \"recovery point objective (RPO)\". For the scenario of a data center failure, Finoa has processes in place for switching to a back up data center in order to continue IT operations. Additionally, a plan on what to do in case of a possible failure of the switchover is provided. Finoa takes on a risk oriented approach for incrementally expanding its BCM on to different scenarios in order to achieve full coverage.\nFinoa continuously adapts its emergency management to possible changes and threats and intends to permanently be aware of dependencies which could interfere with the emergency plan. In order to verify the emergency plan, Finoa annually performs emergency drills, following an exercise framework which is outlined in the emergency manual. The drills also cover, if necessary, service providers for outsourced activities or processes. Finoa aims to establish a multi-year exercise plan which orchestrates different scenarios and takes the individual system components as well as their grouping into system networks and processes into account.","The management board shall define an IT strategy that is consistent with the business strategy.

Finoa's organizational structure is designed to be able to quickly adapt to changing external and internal requirements. It is important to guarantee the principles of segregation of functions\/duties or incompatible activities and freedom from conflict. This has led to the formation of several functional teams as listed below (represented through Table 01). Projects or similar activities are then set up as cross-functional teams with experts as needed from the respective functional teams .\nFinoa's IT organizational structure consists of the organizational chart as well as the job and function descriptions of the respective functions recognizable in the organizational chart.\nThe Managing Directors manage the Institute's business and are supported in this by the heads of the divisions (C-Levels). The responsibilities are governed by the organizational chart. The organizational chart is updated on a regular basis and as needed. The responsibility for updating lies with the People Team departments. Further information on the respective roles outside the IT - organization can be found in the job profile documentation.\nThe management of the development and operation of information technology used by Finoa is the responsibility of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), who is backed by the CTO Office to achieve this goal. Finoa\u2019s CTO reports to the Managing Director \u201cMarket 1\u201d. As a result, there is direct communication between the management and the IT department at all times, so that the management can ensure that regulations made by it are implemented effectively. Responsibilities within the management have been defined in the business allocation plan. The CTO office consists of staff functions for concerns that span the tech organization. These include tech project management and architecture.\nIn order to ensure adequate staffing, the IT area is divided into further departments, whose respective heads report to the CTO. These departments include: Platform Engineering, Product Engineering and Security Engineering. The CTO, the heads of these departments, and the principal architect form the Core Tech Leadership Team (CTL) and act as main steering body for issues within IT.\nThe respective areas are staffed with additional personnel depending on their focus domains (represented through Image 01). These report in each case to the corresponding head of the department. This type of subdivision of the IT organization with the corresponding reporting channels is necessary in order to maintain full control over the entire IT-relevant areas in the course of current and anticipated future growth.","IT governance is the structure used to manage and monitor the operation and further development of IT systems including the related IT processes on the basis of the IT strategy.

In case customers do not manage to solve their issues with the information provided on Finoa\u2019s web and online pages, customer support is provided directly to customers by Finoa\u2019s Customer support team as a 1st line support. In order to enable efficient support, a ticketing system has been implemented to meet the increasing volumes and demands. 2nd line support, requiring more knowledge, is provided by a subteam of the Customer support team. This level deals with technical investigation of more complex issues such as login files or error messages. However, it is to be noted that the 2nd line support does not handle issues that require code changes and is not only accessible via escalated tickets from 1st line support, but is also directly accessible to employees and key accounts. The already mentioned ticketing tool is also used by 2nd line support. 3rd line support is mainly provided by some of the most senior engineers in case system changes in the productive systems are required (Operations support). 3rd line support uses JIRA for managing the ticketing process. SRE (Site reliability engineering) is provided due to a 24\/7 on-call schedule by the Platform Engineering team. When it comes to changes in the organization\u2019s own code, line 4 support is provided by expert engineers (Development). The ticketing tool is furthermore used by the respective development groups is GitLab. Escalated 2nd line support tickets, security issues as well as alerts from Finoa\u2019s internal monitoring system are handled by the 3rd and 4th line support teams.

For this purpose, objectives are defined and planned on a quarterly basis using the OKR methodology. Therefore, Finoa\u2019s company OKRs, which derive from Finoa\u2019s business strategy and are approved by the Management Board, are translated into specific goals and objectives for the IT organization. These Tech OKRs are then approved by the CTO. Hence, the Tech OKRs define the Objectives and Key Results which the IT organization needs to achieve in order to fulfill the company\u2019s development plans. Objectives need to be clearly formulated regarding the desired end state\/outcome and shall contribute to a company goal stated in the company-wide OKRs. Each Objective has clear Key Results defined to monitor its level of completion, a progress meter and a probability of success. The methodology is chosen to achieve the necessary transparency regarding the development of strategic goals and ensuring a sustainable IT-Strategy. Additionally, Finoa, and therefore the IT organization, works with KPIs. In contrast to the OKRs, which focus on a future-oriented development of the IT organization, KPIs are used to measure current processes and operations non context-sensitive. The KPIs of the IT area are explained in the following sections of this document.\nIn order to monitor the target achievement of set objectives in the OKR methodology, a quarterly evaluation is carried out and reported to the tech management about the completion rate and impact of the individual OKRs. Findings during operation of the IT architecture are included in strategic considerations. Hence, IT involvement is ensured and management and the IT organization enabled to make necessary adjustments in time, such as mitigating target failures, or updating priorities. These adjustments will then be included in newly defined OKRs and tracked accordingly. This ensures that all activities, which deliver on achieving the goals as defined in the IT strategy, are steered and tracked in a consistent manner.\nKey Performance Indicators for IT\nTo ensure in quantitative terms that critical areas of IT are adequately resourced, the Management Board commissioned the IT organization to set up appropriate metrics for the areas of information risk management, information security management, IT operations and application development in order to measure the status and ongoing development.
